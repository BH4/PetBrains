Life simulation. Cells must eat to survive longer and each cell has its own neural network. This is still very preliminary, individuals neural networks do not update and instead the only learning happens through the genetic algorithm. Suprisingly this does eventually result in a circular food searching pattern, but this learning method is obviously very inefficient.

I have had many ideas for this since I made it years ago. I would like to have the neural networks learn via reinforcement learning while each cell is alive. I would also like to expand the program in such a way that there could be multiple species at once with different goals.
