Unresolved
-Some cells are not erased correclty when they are on the side of the screen

-food is not erased at the end of a generation so the screen is blacked out instead

-not evolving
after inserting an inteligent cell into the simulation it was able to find food well and breed to create the next generation in the correct
proportion, but these new cells were idiots.
=Was seemingly able to resolve the problem by changing the input neurons. instead of passing

-can get error when best fitness is 0
