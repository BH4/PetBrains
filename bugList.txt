Unresolved
-Some cells are not erased correclty when they are on the side of the screen

-food is not erased at the end of a generation so the screen is blacked out instead



Resolved?
-can get error when best fitness is 0



Resolved.
-not evolving
after inserting an inteligent cell into the simulation it was able to find food well and breed to create the next generation in the correct
proportion, but these new cells were idiots.
=Was seemingly able to resolve the problem by changing the input neurons. instead of passing positions of all food I only pass the closest food
However, I suspect this may have only resolved the problem because in the first round of breeding this individual was allowed to breed with itself
causing little to no genetic variation. More tests are necessary
